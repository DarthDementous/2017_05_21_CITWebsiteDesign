			Dark Souls is a third-person action role-playing game. 
			The core mechanic of the game is exploration. Players are encouraged by the game to proceed with caution, learn from past mistakes, or find alternate areas to explore. 
			Dark Souls takes place in a large and continuous open world environment, connected through a central hub area (Firelink Shrine). 
			Players are able to travel to and from areas and explore various paths at will, although certain prerequisites have to be met in order to unlock certain areas.

			Dark Souls II retains similar mechanics from its predecessors in the Souls series. 
			Being known for its difficulty, both bosses and standard enemies have the potential to kill the player in only a few hits.
			Bad play is punished severely by most enemies, opportunities for recovering health are limited, 
			and as in Demon's Souls, each time upon death, the player's maximum health is reduced (to a certain lower limit) until the player expends a rare item to reverse it. 
			The game uses a form of joint currency called "souls", which are used as both experience points for leveling up and also as currency for purchasing items from shops. 
			Upon death, the player's entire collection of souls are dropped; the player can recover their dropped souls by returning to the spot where they died, 
			but if they die before picking them up, the souls are permanently lost.

		<td id="desc">
			Dark Souls III is an action role-playing game played in a third-person perspective, similar to previous games in the series. 
			According to lead director and series creator Hidetaka Miyazaki, the game's gameplay design followed "closely from Dark Souls II". 
			Players are equipped with a variety of weapons to fight against enemies, such as bows, throwable projectiles, and swords. 
			Shields can act as secondary weapons but they are mainly used to deflect enemies' attacks and protect the player from suffering damage. 
			Each weapon has two basic types of attacks, one being a standard attack, and the other being slightly more powerful that can be charged up, similar to FromSoftware's previous game, 
			Bloodborne. In addition, attacks can be evaded through dodge-rolling. Bonfires, which serve as checkpoints, return from previous installments. Ashes, according to Miyazaki, 
			play an important role in the game. Magic is featured in the game, with a returning magic system from Demon's Souls, now known as "focus points" (FP). 
			When performing spells, the players' focus points are consumed. There are two separate types of Estus Flasks in the game, which can be allotted to fit a players' particular play style.

			collecting different types of useful items that have many uses, interacting with the strange non-player characters, 
			opening up shortcuts, and continuing through the main story.

			Returning features from previous installments include motorbikes, and 12-player racing from Mario Kart Wii, 
			as well as hang gliders, underwater racing and vehicle customization from Mario Kart 7.

			Like in previous games in the series, Super Smash Bros. is a multiplayer fighting game in which the players use various attacks, techniques, 
			and items to deal damage to their opponents and knock their opponents out of the arena. As a character's damage percentage increases, they fly back further when attacked, 
			and may eventually be knocked far enough out of the playing field to be knocked out. To assist players during battle, items sometimes appear on the battlefield if turned on, 
			most of which represent the various video games represented in the series. An item called a Smash Ball allows players to use a powerful, character-specific attack, 
			otherwise known as the "Final Smash". Another item is an Assist Trophy, which summons various non-playable characters from a represented series onto the field to assist the summoner.
